    "Git is highly efficient in creating branches and merging them. This is a useful property for software development projects in which programmers implement different features, fix bugs, and refactor the codebase. These changes are typically implemented in separate branches, which are not affected by coding activities in other parts of the codebase (other branches). When developers decide that the work from their branch should be integrated into a target branch (often the main branch), the `git merge other_branch_name` command starts the merge operation. In this operation, Git uses heuristics to determine whether the changes in both branches are compatible. When developers have changed unrelated parts of the codebase, the branches are merged automatically.\n",
    "\n",
    "However, if the branches introduce changes to the same parts of the codebase, there is no simple rule to decide which change is kept and which is discarded. In this case, Git creates a **merge conflict**, indicating that the user has to indicate which changes should be retained.\n",
